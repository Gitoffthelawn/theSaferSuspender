The Safer Suspender
======================

## Vision

"The Safer Suspender" is a **safer** and free and open-source extension for modern browser, such as **Firefox**, **Edge** and **Chrome**.
Once installed and enabled, this extension will automatically **suspend** tabs that have not been used for a while, freeing up memory and cpu that the tab was consuming.
